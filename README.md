# COMP0034-PHPBasics

#####COMP0034 Code to accompany the PHP Basics lecture slides

You will need to deploy the files to your web server to run them, you cannot simply open a PHP file in a browser.

index.php contains links to some of the example pages, though some need to be run in an IDE rather than the browser to see the output.

In phpMyAdmin, import the user.sql file. This creates a database called phpuser and a user called phpbasics with a password basic.
